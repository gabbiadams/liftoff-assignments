# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I would like to make an app that uses satellite data to show where natural disasters are currently happening on a world map. The natural disasters would be shown with different icons according to what kind of disaster it is, (wildfire, hurricane, etc.) and you can zoom into the map to see what is happening in a particular area. 

This would be useful if you're tracking a natural disaster that is close to you, your property, or someone you know. It would also be useful if you are traveling through an area and are trying to avoid a natural disaster.

I got this idea after a friend told me about his work on a similar project, and found out that NASA had an API that provides natural disaster data.

### Features

Natural disasters map: Users can look at a world map and see markers for natural disasters currently happening.
Zoom: Users can zoom into map to look at a particular location more closely. 
Search: Users can search a location and it will zoom to that location on the map.
Icons w/ Content: Each type of natural disaster will have it's own map marker icon. When a user clicks on these icons, it will display what type of disaster it is, and where it is located.

### Technologies

JavaScript,
React JS,
Google Maps API,
NASA API,
HTML,
CSS

### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll have to learn how to work with Google Maps API, NASA API, and I'm not very familiar with React JS. I have never worked with either of these API's, so I'll be using several youtube videos and the API documentation. I'll also be referencing several videos on Udemy to help me with React.
